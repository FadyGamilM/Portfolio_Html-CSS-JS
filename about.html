               <p>
                  With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that
                   the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed.
                    All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final 
                    product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.
               </p>
               <p>
                  For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly
                   focused communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the 
                   application according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning 
                   properly with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.
